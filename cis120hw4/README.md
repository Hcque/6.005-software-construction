### CIS 120 Homework 4: Pennstagram

## Homework Instructions

Please follow the instructions available here:

*   [Homework Description](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis120/current/hw04)

## Running your code and tests

Note that the Codio menu now provides two modes of running your project:

*   Running the Java application in your browser

*   First “Compile” to update the code generated by your program.

*   Then use the “Run Java (GUI)” menu. This will start your application.

*   To view the running application, in the menu bar to the right of the previous item, select Pennstagram. Assuming that a program is running, it will show the running application in a new window or tab.

*   To run the JUnit Tests, use the "Test Project" menu item. (There is also
    an option in Codio under Tools -> JUnit (Beta). This will not work for
    this project.) 

## Zipping and Submitting

Once you are finished, use the “Zip” menu item to create a file called “submit-hw04(-time).zip” and upload it to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/132357)
