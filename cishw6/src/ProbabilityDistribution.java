/**
 * This class represents a probability distribution over a type T as a map from
 * T values to integers. We can think of this map as a "histogram" of the
 * frequency of occurrences observed for T values.
 * 
 * We can build a probability distribution by "recording" new occurrences of a
 * value. For instance, if we want to build a probability distribution over
 * String values, we might record the following occurrences: record("a");
 * record("b"); record("a"); record("a"); record("c")
 * 
 * The resulting distribution would map "a" to a frequency count of 3, and "b"
 * and "c" both to 1, since we recorded only one of each.
 * 
 * We can sample (a.k.a. "pick") an element from the probability distribution at
 * random, based on the frequency information in the records.
 * 
 * For instance, given the distribution above, we would pick "a" with 3/5
 * probability and each of "b" and "c" with 1/5 probability. Of the 5 total
 * observations, 3 were "a". (Assuming that the number generator is truly random
 * -- a non-random number generator, which is useful for testing, might yield
 * different outcomes.)
